# Research in Smart Cities with AI: Public Sharing Systems ðŸš—ðŸš²

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my PhD research on **Smart Cities** with a focus on **AI-driven Public Sharing Systems** at the Chair of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Mannheim.

This repository contains code, data, and research related to optimizing and analyzing public sharing systems in the context of smart cities. The project leverages machine learning, optimization algorithms, and data analysis to improve public transportation, bike-sharing, and other shared resources within urban environments.

## Research Focus ðŸŽ¯

The main objective of my research is to explore how AI technologies can enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and accessibility of public sharing systems. This includes:

- **Public Bike-Sharing Networks**
- **Traffic Analysis**
- **Demand Prediction**
- **Infrastructure Optimization**
- **User Behavior Analysis**

## Key Repositories ðŸ”‘

Here are the repositories related to my research:

### 1. [Trip Destination Prediction](https://github.com/PhD-Kerger/trip-destination-prediction-public)

Machine Learing approach to predict the destination coordinates of vehicles based on GBFS fields with XGBoost multi-target regression.
